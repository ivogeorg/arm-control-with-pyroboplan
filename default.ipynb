You can solve it *analytically* using the geometry of the robot, but this often does not work because the model has too many degrees of freedom, or there are other constraints like joint limits and collisions that need to be accounted for. So there are many *numerical methods* to do this.\n",

    "![image](images/rrt_2dof_config_space.png)\n",

    "* **Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM)**: This is a *multi-query planner*, meaning that once you generate a graph of randomly-sampled points and connect them together, you can search multiple times using that same graph. It's a lot of up-front construction time for fast and reusable motion planning, which can be useful in static environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)**: This is a *single-query planner*, meaning that the tree (which is a type of graph) is \"grown\" from the start to the goal and then discarded. RRTs, as their name suggest, are faster and more sample-efficient than PRMs, but they are single-use. Sometimes, RRTs are *bidirectional*, meaning two parallel trees are grown from both start and goal and they are connected somewhere in the middle.\n",

    "### Trajectory generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The path planners above only return *paths*; that is, a list of waypoints, but no information about timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real robots have limits such as velocity, acceleration, and torque limits. So paths need to be converted to *trajectories*, which describe how those paths are followed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of representing trajectories. Two popular ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Trapezoidal velocity trajectories:** Used in industrial settings because they are easy to implement and have guarantees on joint velocity/acceleration limits.\n",
    "* **Polynomial trajectories:** Usually cubic (3rd order) or quintic (5th order). These trajectories provide smooth profiles that can pass through waypoints at specific velocities and accelerations, but they may \"overshoot\" their waypoints and therefore need to be checked carefully against joint limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, you can change the settings and look at results from both kinds of trajectory generation methods.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Trajectory Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use nonlinear optimization to generate trajectories. There are two main types of methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Direct transcription:** Here, you usually discretize your robot dynamics into small steps and optimize for each individual trajectory point. It's powerful, but can get very slow with long segments.\n",
    "* **Direct collocation:** What if we take the representations in the previous section, like polynomial trajectories, and instead optimize over the boundary conditions of the trajectories? These are more widely used in practice, even though they do limit the representation space of trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about nonlinear optimization is that you can introduce arbitrary constraints into the problem. This includes things like position, velocity, acceleration, or even jerk limits. It can also be dynamic constraints like force/torque, limits, or even geometric constraints like collision avoidance!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the flexibility of nonlinear optimization, you can actually directly optimize a simple straight-line path and  get a valid trajectory out of it.\n",

    "You have now seen some of the basics of motion planning for robot manipulators using [PyRoboPlan](https://github.com/sea-bass/pyroboplan).\n",

    "Many other tools in the robotics and ROS ecosystem exist for motion planning. Some that you should know include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**MoveIt:**](https://github.com/moveit/moveit2) Contains good support for ROS enabled robots, including a direct connection to `ros2_control`.\n",
    "* [**Tesseract:**](https://github.com/tesseract-robotics/tesseract) Inspired by MoveIt, but redesigned to be better suited for trajectory optimization and prototyping using easy-to-use Python bindings.\n",
    "* [**Drake:**](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) Contains state-of-the-art optimization based planning capabilities, but the ROS interface is experimental.\n",
    "* [**Pinocchio:**](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) Includes all the tools you need to model a robot, but does not inherently have any motion planning capabilities. However, many tools are built on Pinocchio.\n",
